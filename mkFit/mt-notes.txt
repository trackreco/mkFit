1. MkFitter::FindCandidatesMinimizeCopy() -- see comment XXXX MT FIXME in the
   middle of index vector initialization loops.
   In short - it's about supporting partial SlurpIn and masked intrinsics.

   Matriplex could have a MAX_N member that would be used for non-vectorized
   code. I'm not super sure about that -- if we limit the loading of data and
   then never read out the parts that were not used it costs us nothing (or
   little) to do operations on whole vectors.

2. Fix access of hits out of bunch_of_hits in FindCandidatesMinimizeCopy().
   When we determine phi range for each track, this can oveflow over the end
   of the array.
   - Replace XHitBegin/XHitEnd with XHitPos/XHitSize
   - Calculate them properly including phi wrap in SelectHitRanges()
   - In FindCandidatesMinimizeCopy() wrap back the index vector.

   Or, alternatively, copy a couple of front hits to the back.
   Ouch, this is not so trivial, need to fix overrrun in the other direction,
   too! Heh, I could always copy the last couple of hits to the front :)
   No ... the first solution is fine!

   Note --- there is also the maxSize there counter + a hack limiting it to 25
   there. We should also fix this properly, either by restricting the number
   of phi bins or by killing the candidates whose errors get too big.

3. Hand-made multi-threading for eta bins.

   Later, multi-threading over multiple events to fill all slots and to not
   stall waiting for threads that take longer to process.

   Note, current simulation produces higher occupancy at higher eta.

   Once we have endcaps, the transition region will also become more
   expensive.

4. Attempt number two at prefetching in a service thread.

5. Make MkFitter use a single array of hits, copy in as they are needed.
   Now we have a fixed set of 10 hits ... this was done for final fitting so
   we could copy in all the hits in the beginning.
   Or, if it turns out this makes sense for fitting, separate MkFitter and
   MkBuilder, optionally using a common MkBase.

6. Implement write/read events for the new event/track/hit format.
   Started doing this on glut.

Thread pinning on MIC (no real difference)
